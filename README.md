# Understanding Spatial Regression Models from a Weighting Perspective in an Observational Study of the Impact of Superfund Cleanups on Birth Weight

This repository contains the code for the simulation and data application sections of the paper. The workflow is:

- `funcs.R` contains all utility functions for the simulation and data applicaton. 
- `simulation` contains the code for the simulation section of the paper. The simulation is fully reproducible. 
- `application` contains the code for the data application section of the paper. 

### Data
The Superfund site and census data were obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Census Bureau, respectively.
The Medicaid individual-level birth outcome data are stored in the Harvard Regulated Data Environment, a Level-4 FISMA-moderate secure data platform. 

### Acknowledgements
The simulations in this paper were run on the FASRC cluster supported by the FAS Division of Science Research Computing Group at Harvard University.
